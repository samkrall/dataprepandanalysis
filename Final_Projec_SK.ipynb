    "# Dive into Data \"by Metro\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we see here is really two data tables, connected via primary/foreign key. One data table is the geographical dimension. This table consists of the primary key of metro area or \"RegionName\" in this table as well as the RegionID, SizeRank, RegionType and StateName columns. The other table is a fact table that contains date, ZHVI and metro data. TThis table has a composite primary key consisting of date and metro and then continuous data, ZHVI.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to drop geographically related columns, apart from the Metro then I want to \"Tidy\" data. Tidying is structuring the data in a way that makes it easy for a computer to navigate. If you've worked with relational databases, its the structure that exists there. If you want more information on Tidy Data, read this paper (https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules for tidy data are each row is an observation and each column is a fact about an observation. I'm going to bring in a bunch of data at the **Metro** level only. I'm also going to pull geo data beyond \"metro\" out. It can be easily re-added later via a join with the Metro columns acting as a key.\n",

    "I'm going to repeat this for a bunch of different variables for metro. The hope is to find patterns in the data that can help to pinpoint metros that will be good candidates for investment"

Data that goes down to the zip level includes ZHVI, ZHVF, ZORI for all homes. The df_finals dataset has projected growth on the 1M, 3M and 12M timeframe.

This metro is hot, has low time to sale and pending. Lower inventory. These zip codes have a high projected growth rate. Homes are inexpensive here. \n",

    "If we're investing in an area there are two ways to make money, from rent or from appreciation. I want to visualize what the price level is on a property, what can be made from rent and forecasted appreciation on the same graph. To do that I'm going to gather data by zip code and combine ZHVI and ZORI into a single value (divide ZORI which is should track to revenue by ZHVI which tracks to cost) and plot against Projected 12M growth rate.\n",
